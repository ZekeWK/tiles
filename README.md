## Tiles
A wave function collapse implementation in rust. 

It uses generics as flags which was a design decision from curiosity.

Examples:
ascii:
A map of heights with occasional houses in ascii art.

carcassonne:
Inspired by the board game of Carcassonne it creates a large map in the same style.
